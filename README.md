 c102 Week 02:
=======

Instructions for today's lab
----------------------------
1. Open a new tab in your browser (say, Chrome), navigate to the LMS page of comp10002
1. Click on `LMS` --> `Working with jEdit and gcc`, and follow the instructions for `Write and run your program in the MSE lab`. 
Hints: You should resize and re-arrange the windows so that at the same time
you can fully see both **Chrome** and **minGW** windows, and when in need, see both **jEdit** and **minGW** windows.
1. In the **minGW** window try the folloing commands. You will need to use these commands (there are only three of them: `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`) very frequently. 


Command | Explaination and notes
------- | ------------
`cd h:` | make your `H:` driver be the "current working folder" (CWF)
`ls`    | display content of CWF
`mkdir Projects` | make a new folder named `Projects`
`cd Projects` | change CWF to `Project`. Note: only type `cd P` then press \<TAB\>, hich will autocomplete your command
`mkdir comp10002` | make a new folder
`cd comp10002` | change CWF, remember to employ \<TAB\> for autofilling
`mkdir Week2`  | make a new folder 
`cd Week2`     |
`ls`           | you will see that there is no content. You will place all files of this week in this folder.
 
Then
----
1. Implement Exercise 1.2: Edit, save, compile, and run `helloworld.c`. For that, follow the steps in `LMS` --> `Working with jEdit and gcc`
1. Implement exercise 2.8. If you still don't have a copy of the textbook, you can click [here](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/ammoffat/teaching/10002/e/e02-08.tiff). Note that the exercies are supplied only for the first 
Advice: Buy the book ASAP, it's a good investment :smile: 
1. Implement exercise 2.4. A quick way is to use the skeleton e24.c by
   1. Click on **e24.c** [above](./equation.c)
   1. Copy the content of that **e24.c** and paste into your **jEdit** window
   1. Save as **H:/Projects/comp10002/Week2/e24.c**
   1. Complete and test your **e24.c** 
1. Follow the advise below


The best way of using the material in this github site
--------------------------------------------------
  * Download this whole **c102** directory by clicking **Clone or Download** --> **Download ZIP**, it will normally be downloaded to your **Downloads** directory
  * Then copy the directory **c102** from **Downloads** to your working directory, i.e. to under H:/Projects/comp10002/Week2/
  * Compile, run, and explore *guessNumber.c*, have some fun
  * Note that *explained_guessNumber.c* is the same as *guessNumber.c*, but also has heap of explainations, but don't try hard to understand everything 
  * Repair and complete *equation.c* if you haven't done so 

Important Homework
-----------------
1. If you haven't installed minGW/jEdit on your laptop, do it at home ASAP and within this week. Instruction for installation is available at **LMS** --> **Working with jEdit and gcc** --> **installing jEdit and gcc on your own computer** 
1. IMPORTANT NOTE: When installing minGW (in step 3 of the above mentioned instruction, when the dialog box appears), scroll down to find and mark the item "msys-openssh bin" for installation.
1. Now, if you are inside uni, you can use your laptop and connect to uni's computer dimefox (see instructions in 
**LMS** --    > **Working with jEdit and gcc** --> **Compiling and running programs on dimefox**
1. However, if you work from home, to be able to do step 3, you must first run VPN. If you don't know what and/or how, please ask Google. A simple query like "VPN unimelb" could be a good start.
