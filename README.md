   * Slides for this week, that contains a few Q&A that might be useful for assignment 2.
And some other accompanying files. If you want to try, you'd better to download the whole directory into your workplace. The accompanying files include:
  * `array.c`: a full version of `darray.c` that we developped in the class last week. The full version also includes a function for free-ing arrays.
  * `test.c`: which using array.c to implement stack and then uses
the stack. The program have some problems with memory leaks, and is used to demonstrating how to use valgrind to check your program for memory leaks (see the slides).   
   * `gdb-tutorial-handout.pdf` and `gdb_cheatsheet.pdf`, which you can obviuosly easily find in the Internet: short guide on how to use gdb to debug your programs.
