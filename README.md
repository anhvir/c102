c102 Week 4
=======
This week:

  * `insertion_sort.c` and `int_array.txt`: a complete program 
and data for inputting an array and printing out
the sorted array, using insertion sort.
It also demonstrates how insertion works.
You can also use this `.c` file for exercise 7.3.
  * `e6.9.c`: skeleton for implementing exercise 6.9
  * `e7.4.Sol1.c`: skeleton for the trivial solution of exercise 7.4
  * `e7.4.Sol2.c`: skeleton for Solution 2 of exercise 7.4, here you
need to invent a smart solution based on some constraints on the
input data.

#How to download/copy the files in this github repository

If you just want a single file, say, `e56.c`:
  * Click on `e56.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit window, then save as `e56.c` 

If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c102-master` or `c102-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c102` from `Downloads` to under your working folder `week3/`
  * If the downloaded `c102-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c102-master.ZIP`
