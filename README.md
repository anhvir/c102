 c102 Week 03:
=======
Content for this week:
  * `frame.c` is a frame for any C program!
  * `grapher.c` is a frame for implementing Exercise 4.5
  * `grapher.data` contains sample input data for Exercises 4.5
  * `e56.c` is a skeleton for Exercise 5.6
  * `e56.data` is sample input data for Exercise 5.6
  * `mary.txt` is sample input data for exercises 4.6 and 4.7

If you just want a single file, say, `e56.c`:
  * Click on `e56.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit window, then save as `e56.c` 

If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c102-master` or `c102-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c102` from `Downloads` to under your working folder `week3/`
  * If the downloaded `c102-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c102-master.ZIP`

How to use sample input data, say, for e46.c? I am really tired with typing the data again and again each time I test my progarm!
  * Make sure that you have the data file mary.txt in your working folder. 
  * After compiling your program into, say, `e46.exe`, just run:
  *                   `./e46.exe < mary.txt`
  * your program will run, and instead of reading input data from the keyboard, it will read from the file `mary.txt`. So convenient!
