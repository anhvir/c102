This week:

    * insertion_sort.c and insertion_sort.data:
`a complete program` 
`and data for inputting an array and printing out`
`the sorted array. They can be used as a starting point`
`for Ex 7.3, and 7.4. They can  also be used without any`
`change, and in this case insertion_sort  will show how`
`insertion sort works.` 

    * Additional task with insertion_sort.c:
`change the sorting function so that it does not use`
`int_swap at all, and as a result, runs a bit faster.`

    * coin_change.c : contains some initial settings for Ex 6.9.
